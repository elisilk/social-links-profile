## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- [Flex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex) - I still have to get more comfortable with Flex, especially knowing [what is the main axis and what is the cross axis](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex), and then how that changes to use of and behavior of the [align-\* vs. justify-\* properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Aligning_items_in_a_flex_container). I really wanted to create a profile box that filled the available space but had a max width after which point it would no longer grow.

### Continued development

- [Principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) - I want to be more consistent and organized in how I order my CSS files and provide comments.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) - Of course, as always. So useful.
